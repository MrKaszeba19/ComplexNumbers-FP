# Complex Numbers for FreePascal

**Author**: Paul Lipkowski

## About
I decided to write my own complex numbers mechanism, as FreePascal's built-in mechanism isn't sufficient enough for me.  

## Features

### As of now
- basic routines, type casting
- powers, square and cubic roots
- exponential and logarithmic functions
- trigonometric functions and their inverses
- hyperbolic and area functions
- MinusOneTo, ImagTo, MinusImagTo
- isZero, isNatural, isInteger, isReal, isNotReal, isImaginary, isComplex boolean functions
- ComplexNumPolar (initializing a complex number with polar coords)
- gamma, gammaln functions
- lower and upper incomplete gamma functions
- erf, erfc, erfi functions

### Todo list
- beta, lower incomplete beta functions
- round
- sinc 
- Riemann's Zeta function
- Lambert's W function with branches
- Ei function with branches

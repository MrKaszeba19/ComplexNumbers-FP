# Complex Numbers for FreePascal

**Author**: Paul Lipkowski

## About
I decided to write my own complex numbers mechanism, as FreePascal's built in mechanism isn't sufficient enough for me.  

## Features

### As of now
- basic routines, type casting
- exponential and logarithmic functions
- trigonometric functions and their inverses

### Todo list
- hyperbolic and area functions
- gamma, gammaln, lower incomplete gamma functions
- beta, lower incomplete beta functions
- erf, erfc
- sinc 
- minusOneTo
- ComplexNumPolar (initializing a complex number with polar coords)
- isZero, isNatural, isInteger, isReal, isImaginary, isComplex boolean functions
